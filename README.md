## Documentation

The app allows search for any query by specifying the exact location you are interested in. You are allowed to specify the Latitude and Longitude coordinates as well as the location radius in meters. This gives you full control over the results.

Also, Google Maps Services returns 20 results for every successful query so the app contains a "next-page" functionality that allows you view the next 20 results from the API until you have exhausted all the results for your query.

Finally, data is useless if it cannot be re-used. Therefore the app allows you to export the results generated. You can either download the data, convert to pdf or convert to CSV format so you could edit it in applications like Microsoft Excel.
